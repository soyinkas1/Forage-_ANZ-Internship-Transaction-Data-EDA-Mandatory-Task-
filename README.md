ANZ- Exploratory Data Analysis (Mandatory Task) 

Background Information 

This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.  
The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights you can gather from the tasks below will be genuine.  

ANZ- Predictive Analytics (Mandatory Task)

Background Information

This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

Using the same transaction dataset, identify the annual salary for each customer

Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data (e.g. age) or those that you construct or derive yourself (e.g. those relating to purchasing behaviour). Visualise any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.

Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above
How accurate is your model? Should ANZ use it to segment customers (for whom it does not have this data) into income brackets for reporting purposes?

For a challenge: build a decision-tree based model to predict salary. Does it perform better? How would you accurately test the performance of this model?
